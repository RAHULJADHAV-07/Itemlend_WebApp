# 🚀 ItemLend – Peer-to-Peer Lending Web App

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-blueviolet?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel)](https://itemlend-webapp.onrender.com/)

**ItemLend** is a role-based React web application that empowers users to **lend or borrow items** within their community. Inspired by the sharing economy, it enables people to access everyday items like cameras, tools, and sports gear — without owning them.
